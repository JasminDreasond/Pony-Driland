## Pony Adventures

Year: 2018 or 2017

Pony Adventures was the genesis that originated the ideia of creating Pony Driland more than 5 years ago. Yes, the initial idea was Pony Driland to be a game, but it eventually evolved into a fic.

As strange as it sounds, this was an extension for Google Chrome as the idea was to use your browser features to create a more immersive environment, and the project never received an alpha version released for the obvious reasons that the project evolved into a fic.

This game is from a time that I was very novice in programming, so don't expect something great coming from here. This is just a preservation of the past of fic Pony Driland.

I had thought I had lost these files because there is no repository of development of this game. I managed to recover 95% of the original files from the game, probably the lost files was just the files that made the chrome extension work. All original files in this repository have not been modified. I just removed a test image that did not belong to the original artist who was helping to develop the game.

Due to the fact that at this time I knew absolutely nothing about English, a lot here will be written in Portuguese, but I imagine that maybe some translator is enough for you to translate what you find interesting to study.

The images of the game were developed by an illustrator who unfortunately I no longer remember his real nickname on the internet. Because he's deactivated Deviantart's profile and completely disappeared. I appreciate who can recover lost media content from this artist.
