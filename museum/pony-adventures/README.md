## Pony Adventures

Year: 2018 or 2017

Pony Adventures was the genesis that originated the ideia of creating Pony Driland more than 5 years ago. Yes, the initial idea was Pony Driland to be a game, but it eventually evolved into a fic.

The funny part is that at first this game was to be an offline version of NeoPets that later evolved into a survival and adventure game.

As strange as it sounds, this was an extension for Google Chrome as the idea was to use your browser features to create a more immersive environment, and the project never received an alpha version released for the obvious reasons that the project evolved into a fic.

This game is from a time that I was very novice in programming, so don't expect something great coming from here. This is just a preservation of the past of fic Pony Driland.

I had thought I had lost these files because there is no repository of development of this game. I managed to recover 95% of the original files from the game, probably the lost files was just the files that made the chrome extension work. All original files in this repository have not been modified. I just removed a test image that did not belong to the original artist who was helping to develop the game.

Due to the fact that at this time I knew absolutely nothing about English, a lot here will be written in Portuguese, but I imagine that maybe some translator is enough for you to translate what you find interesting to study.

The images of the game were developed by an illustrator who unfortunately I no longer remember his real nickname on the internet. Because he's deactivated Deviantart's profile and completely disappeared. I appreciate who can recover lost media content from this artist.

## Game stuff that were brought to fic

All the initial concept about Smartmoby and the Master Smartmoby was started in this game, and there are images in this folder about how that device would be.

The first version of the device was to be Pip-Boy more compacted as a Smart Clock, but the idea was changing over time, as it would be very uncomfortable for the characters to have a device in their arms that stays practically for all eternity using it. The game was literally played in real time, there was no pause, and if you ignored the game, you would be penalized, as the game knew how long you got inactive without playing.

The game had health bars that decreased at a speed of hours for the bar to become empty. If you remember when I commented that the game was initially created to be an offline NeoPets, this is where you will now understand why these health bars worked this way.

The idea of this game would be you being a person who mysteriously discovers the extension of the Google Chrome, and this extension has the power to transport you to the dimension of Pony Driland, where the entire original story of the fic happens. This concept was kept on the fic, just by changing the Google Chrome extension for the idea that you find Smartmoby in real life that basically does the same thing. In the original game when you install the extension, you also find Smartmoby for the first time. The idea is to get confused about what the extension is and click the button to start the game to start your journey, which is exactly what happens at the beginning of the original fic story.

This is the main justification that the characters Vinny and Yasmin are alternative versions of real people, following precisely this principle that was created in the original idea of the game Pony Adventures.

There is much more content that I have developed, but it has not been placed in the original game folder. Rainbow Queen already existed at the beginning of the game's development, but it was not the same Rainbow Queen of the final version. Although Rainbow Queen 2018 has already had some of the features of the current Rainbow Queen as the energy control skills that were already dark since the beginning, this Rainbow Queen has not yet had a deep story, as there were no characters like James and Rayane.

Rainbow Queen of 2018 reminded much more of an organic version of a Rainbow Factory (brony fic), which was the first inspiration used to create the character before she was transformed into the Rainbow Queen we know today.
