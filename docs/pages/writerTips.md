<h2 id="ai_tips_writers">AI Tips for writers</h2>
<p>Understand that these tips are not for AI to write a fic for you, but to help you yourself be more productive when
    writing your fic. First you need an AI environment that accepts to interpret your entire story, regardless of its
    size.
    <br />
    If your fic is on a public website and it's free, it won't make any difference you use a corporate AI or a private
    AI environment locally on your computer. Because your fic may already have been used to train AI by these companies
    or
    physical people who create AI models to write roleplay or anything else.
    <br /><br />
    The easiest way to deal with this is to accept this reality so you feel safer to continue with the process.
    After choosing where you want to practice the tips below, you can continue seeing the tips now.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_1">Avoid emulations of your fic through AI</h4>
<p>The less developed your fic, the more artificial it will be when AI tries to emulate your characters and the fic
    universe.
    I don't like doing this kind of thing because AI will always try to mix your story and what AI model thinks
    "your
    characters should be". First of all, AI is just an emulation about what AI already knows what exists, that means
    that
    AI will not try to create a new idea, but reuse what already exists to try to create something new.
    <br /><br />
    If your fic does not yet have an identity, it will destroy the creative development of your story. You will always
    be stuck to what has already been developed in your fic and what the AI model knows.
    Although I don’t like this idea, I can say that maybe this works better if your fic is too advanced in the
    development enough to emulate the entire universe of your
    fic. A fic completely rich in itself identity can be much easier to use AI for this kind of thing.
    <br /><br />
    You can try to use AI to try to have an idea about the decisions of your characters, but making a complete emulation
    is <strong>not recommended</strong>.
    Leave this part exclusively for your community's fan service that will probably use this to create roleplay chatbots
    using your fic characters. My opinion is that emulation of characters is fun if you are doing this for
    <strong>entertainment</strong>, and <strong>not for development</strong>.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_2">Request text fixes</h4>
<p>I just started using AI for this kind of thing in the beginning of 2024, so this correction process can still take a
    long time depending on my patience. (saying this in 10/30/2024)
    Ask AI several times where there are possible writing issues in your fic, this can be extremely useful if your
    English is not yet fully fluent.
    If your native language is not English and you ask this question through your language, be careful, sometimes AI can
    try to translate the name of your characters to your native language.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_3">Your best friend to talk about your Fic</h4>
<p>One of the more things that can be common for writers is the loneliness of being able to talk to someone about their
    fic. Sometimes you have many friends who have no patience to stay reading everything you wrote to ask for feedback.
    <br /><br />
    This may be the most extremely interesting part of you using your AI. You can have a time of your day and put your
    fic inside an AI to stay several hours chatting about everything that happened in the story.
    Imagine you can have a friend who you can talk about your fic at the time you want, when you want, about anything
    you want, this is the experience of using AI, making all this experience very fun.
    But this will depend solely on the writer's creativity in asking questions for AI, because AI will only provide you
    a good conversation if you starts these good conversations.
    <br /><br />
    You can ask about what AI thinks about the last parts you've posted from your fic, question what AI thinks about
    your characters and explore what your readers might be thinking when reading your story right now.
    <br /><br />
    This part is interesting, but I would recommend you to do on a locally closed AI on your computer. You can ask AI
    about theories that AI thinks about your fic. Sometimes the answers to these questions can help you bring
    inspiration to
    make these theories something canonical or feed conspiracy theories that can be developed inside your fic to leave
    your reader even
    more stuck in wanting to understand what is happening inside your story.
    <br /><br />
    This allows you yourself to experience a very deep immersion about your own universe of your fic. The more developed
    the universe of your fic, the easier and natural it will be the AI helping you in this kind of conversation.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_4">I don't have a fic, but I want to try it all</h4>
<p>I am a person who respects the world of using AIs, so you don't have to worry about using my fic for that kind of
    thing. But remember that I will support you using my work to AI if you are giving me credits or if you are
    benefiting the
    Pony Driland community.
    You can open the chapters page and click the "Save As all chapters" button, this will make you download a "txt" file
    with everything you need for the AI model to read the fic.
</p>

<h4 id="ai_tips_writers_5">Can I use your fic to train AI?</h4>
<p>As long as you’re doing for the reasons I’ve mentioned about giving credits or benefiting the Pony Driland community,
    I’ll be supporting you. But please be careful if you are mixing my work with the work of other people who think
    differently.
