## Specie

Female / Pegasus

## This character's description may contain possible spoilers!

Yasmin is a version of an alternate universe of myself. (Yasmin Seidel)

The story of this Yasmin separates from my original timeline on the date 24 jul, 2021. 
That means everything that happened to me after this date no longer belongs to the timeline of this character.

This Yasmin has no knowledge of cryptocurrency, knows nothing of what happened after the emergence of 
the current 2024 AI age. In this timeline this Yasmin also knows absolutely nothing about the existence of Pony Driland. 
The Pony Driland story has never been written anywhere in this universe.

Apart from these factors, all the other canonical things happened in the life of this Yasmin, and she faced 
a very unexpected situation in having been brought to Pony Driland by Rainbow Queen.

Yasmin recognizes that many elements of this dimension about ponies are familiar, but she also recognizes that this is not the
same world she has known through stories about ponies in her world.

### Chapter 3

Pony Driland has 2 people contributing to writing the story. The first person is me, and the second person is who plays the character Vinny.

The events of the Chapter 3 on Vinny's bet with Rainbow Queen to save Ivy really happened, and had many discussions about the situation, originally i had no plan to include my character who represents me inside the story, she would be just a background character that just appears in the prologue as an easter egg.

But by Vinny's decision, the situation accidentally came out of control, and I had no more choices, especially because the story had already created all the sense for the situation, and it would not be the same experience trying to create an alternative version of the situation. The best decision was to keep everything the way it was already, and I really had the end that happened to myself in the story.

This character will continue to be canonical, but will also continue to be secondary and will also remain treated as a secondary character, just appearing at times that really need to appear, always at risk of suffering consequences like any other character.
