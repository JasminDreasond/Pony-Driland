                AI Disclaimer
            </h5>
            <p>
                All chapters of the fic were 100% human written.
                Due to the huge number of characters (and because I am a single person both writing,
                both taking care of the character designs), the designs of
                some characters were originally generated by AI and
                you will see in the credits what these images are.
                80% of characters design development first involves a pure AI version
                and then converts it to a final version.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I don't always have the free time to do this with all the characters.
                I hope you understand that I need free time to draw final versions. (and sometimes money when
                I give up and decide to pay an artist to make the final version.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of AI for Pony Driland content is permitted as long as you are making a model that does not
                steal other people's private art styles.
                The definition of private style is defined as a style of art that was made specifically for a specific
                project by an private artist. Always try to use public
                art styles that everyone already uses.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
                Please also avoid using drawings from other artists without permission. There is no set date,
                but soon I will make Lora models myself using my own future drawings to avoid this type of problem.
                I will make a dedicated page just for this. The base model has already been chosen and tested. I just
                need time to do the drawings for the Lora models.
                Other artists who are doing collaborative work (fan made) are also welcome.

<h2 id="inspirations_about">Inspirations about</h2>
<p>If you are more curious about how inspirations happened, you can read exactly here a little about this subject. But
    remember that these texts will say a little about the Pony Driland universe. Then we recommend you read the fic
    before you read this text.</p>

<h4 id="ins_undertale">Undertale</h4>
<p>The Pony Driland universe consists of characters from various universes being trapped inside the dimension Pony
    Driland.
    The story greatly explores the power of these characters' feelings, and this characteristic was very inspired by the
    Undertale universe.
    The feelings of the characters can directly interfere with the state of their souls that may have several different
    effects on the development of each character.

    <br /><br />
    The greatest manifestation of this inspiration is linked to Rainbow Queen, but this is only related to her power.
    (Although Rainbow Queen has references to the character Asriel, this is just a visual reference.)
</p>

<h4 id="ins_glitchtale_season_2">Glitchtale Season 2</h4>
<p>The expansion of ideas on how the power of the characters' souls can be explored came directly from here.
    I've commented a lot on Undertale, so I don't have much to say here.
    <br /><br />
    But there is another visual reference that inspired me here. While Undertale delivered to Rainbow Queen visual
    inspirations from Asriel, here was delivered visual inspirations from BÃªte Noire. That makes you better understand
    where I had the idea of Rainbow Queen owning a scythe.
    But the way the two characters use scythe has different ways. Rainbow Queen uses her scythe as much as a weapon, as
    to protect control of her gigantic amount of power.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_fallout_equestria">Fallout Equestria</h4>
<p>A little of the survival theme was added to Pony Driland, and some parts came directly from the Fallout game.
    But the most inspired part was the Pip-Boy that inspired the creation of the Smartmobies idea.
    The biggest difference between the two devices is that Smartmoby is directly connected to the soul and existence of
    the character within the Pony Driland universe.
    <br /><br />
    Although there is a physical look of Smartmoby, inside the dimension of Pony Driland this device becomes invisible,
    just showing the screen on the character's arm when this character is using it.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_madoka_magica">Madoka Magica</h4>
<p>More elements about soul-use powers have been inspired here. Elements of Pony Driland as the dark energy that
    corrupts the soul of the characters also had inspirations that emerged exactly from this anime.
    <br /><br />
    The Madoka's universe helped as much as the Undertale in the development part as the connection between emotions
    and souls of the characters. Maybe you'll find some characters in the story that I inspired in personality of
    Kyubey, Madoka and, Kyoko.
</p>

<h4 id="ins_dragon_ball">Dragon Ball Super/Z</h4>
<p>The Dragon Ball universe was a great help in the inspiration part of how the characters' powers evolve more
    naturally.
    This anime also helped me explore how very powerful characters behave, how they hide their powers, how they wish to
    reveal their powers, and various other personality characteristics of fighters.
    The fic seeks to explore the evolution of character powers in a very inspired way by Dragon Ball.
    <br /><br />
    Dragon Ball Super helped more specifically in the development of divine characters from Pony Driland.
    This helped me a lot to quickly create an original concept of Pony Driland divinity.
    Just like Undertale and Glitchtale did, Dragon Ball Super left an little visual easter egg in Rainbow Queen inspired
    by the character Beerus.
