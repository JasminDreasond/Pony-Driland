            AI Disclaimer
            </h5>
            <p >
                All chapters of the fic were 100% human written. 
                Due to the huge number of characters (and because I am a single person both writing, 
                both taking care of the character designs), the designs of 
                some characters were originally generated by AI and 
                you will see in the credits what these images are.
                80% of characters design development first involves a pure AI version 
                and then converts it to a final version.
            </p>
            <p >
                But I don't always have the free time to do this with all the characters.
                I hope you understand that I need free time to draw final versions. (and sometimes money when 
                I give up and decide to pay an artist to make the final version.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of AI for Pony Driland content is permitted as long as you are making a model that does not steal other people's private art styles.
                The definition of private style is defined as a style of art that was made specifically for a specific project by an private artist. Always try to use public 
                art styles that everyone already uses.
            </p>
            <p class="m-0">
                Please also avoid using drawings from other artists without permission. There is no set date, 
                but soon I will make Lora models myself using my own future drawings to avoid this type of problem. 
                I will make a dedicated page just for this. The base model has already been chosen and tested. I just need time to do the drawings for the Lora models.
                Other artists who are doing collaborative work (fan made) are also welcome.
