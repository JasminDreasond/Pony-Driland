# Solidity Files

All fanfic smart contract source codes are stored in this folder. Feel free to modify them if you are forking this repository to create your own content. All scripts are open source!

By default I use the Polygon Blockchain due to the extremely low fees of the blockchain, which allows me to create a storage environment that doesn't pay a lot of Matics Fees from your crypto wallet when executing Smart Contracts. 

Right now as I'm typing this, usually the gas fee is $0,00.
